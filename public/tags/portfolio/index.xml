      <description>Adidas AR Exhibition  Roles: Lead Developer, Creative Technologist, AR/VR
Immersive Art Installation — Prague National Gallery Poetry Passage — Immersive environment for projection mapping and custom generative software with visual artist Egill Sæbjörnsson Roles: Lead Developer, Creative Technologist

 
Permanent Installation at Microsoft Cybercrime Center At The Office for Creative Research, we created a permanent installation for the Microsoft Cybercrime Center which maps and visualizes botnets in the wild to give researchers a more intuitive way of understanding their activity over time. Using realtime datasets from millions of infected computers, we created an interactive application that allowed the data to be explored visually and sonically. Roles: Software Development, Creative Technology, Interactive Art and Design

 
ScreamOmeter – Breaking glass with sound at Norwegian Science Museum A collaboration with Gagarin for an installation where people get a chance to break a wine glass by using nothing but their own voice. As a game experience, the installation demonstrated the physics of sympathetic resonance where an audience member’s voice would cause a real glass to shatter. A custom system incorporating architecture, software, physical computing brought the experience to life. Roles: Techncial Direction, Conceptual Development, Creative Technology, Interactive 

 
Art Director and Technical Lead at Wonwei Wonwei is a research-driven design &amp;amp; technology studio working on commissions, products and artworks. Working as Art Director and Technical Lead on a number of projects. Wonwei was commissioned by Universal Music Group to create a realtime and immersive 3D visual show for musician Ólafur Arnalds’ world tour. A software system clandscapes were created to create a atmospheric narrative in response to music during the concert. Each landscape would interact to the live music and movement from the performer using a Kinect camera. Roles: Art Direction, Technical Direction, Software Dev, Creative Technology, Interactive Design

 
 Study For Resonators Fifty resonating structures create a evolving polyrhythmic installation that transform the gallery space into a living sound sculpture. The percussive instruments create an perpetually evolving musical composition, developed using custom software and physical computing to activate the custom designed instruments. Commisioned by media art festival Raflost in Reykjavík, Iceland. Roles: Art Direction, Software Development, Circuit Design, Creative Technology

 
IOT Remote Irrigation System for Sustainable Farming A series of visual compositions were created for an exhibition at Third Space Gallery in Helsinki, Finland. The works explore light phenomena and forms that are barely perceptible from a distance but become clear on closer inspection. A new technique was developed where custom software creates microscopic etching patterns on a glass surface, creating a perceptual play of light, color, and reflections. Roles: Technical Direction, Software Development, Technologist

 
Microperception Window Installation A series of visual compositions were created for an exhibition at Third Space Gallery in Helsinki, Finland. The works explore light phenomena and forms that are barely perceptible from a distance but become clear on closer inspection. A new technique was developed where custom software creates microscopic etching patterns on a glass surface, creating a perceptual play of light, color, and reflections. Roles: Digital laser fabrication, rapid prototyping, software development, art director

 
Invisible Landscapes Invisible Landscapes is an artwork that explores the potential of nano technology as an artistic medium. Focusing on the optical possibilities of light with nano structures, Nano Landscapes combines age old photographic techniques like the camera obscura to project nano-scale forms into architectural space. The result is a translation across scales, as the invisible is rendered visible yet always out of reach. Roles: Creative technologist, rapid prototyping, software development, art director

 
One Hundred Thousand Landscapes One Hundred Thousand Landscapes is a multi-channel sound installation that creates a perpetually evolving sonic landscape from an online database of over 100,000 sound samples. The system searches for sounds that fit certain descriptions to create a sonic environment. This ruleset functions as the “DNA” of the piece, providing an organizing principal to the evolution of the sonic environment. In addition, the system also informs its own progression as each new sound influences the next using spectral descriptors of the sound file to search for other sound files that sound similar. Roles: Software development, art direction, creative technologist

 
 Research in computational print techniques Research and development into custom software systems for generating robust vector and print graphics in C++ / openframeworks. The aim of this research was to develop methods for integrating cinema and photography into a generative print graphics workflow. The project resulted in custom software that provided scalable vector graphics that could be rendered to print or even animation film. This line of research also opens the door for instant creation of unique printed material based on customizable user input. Roles: Software development, artistic research, creative technology

  
Teaching a Robot to Paint Clinamen is a speculative through the language of twenty-first century technology. ]The robot moves burn increasingly intricate patterns into the sculptures until there is nothing left to burn. Over a period of months the robot was “trained” to create paintings. Work on the project included creating custom tools for the robot and developing software for the robot movement. Roles: Software development, Robotics, rapid prototyping, creative technology, art director

 
 Technical Production and Fabrication Commission I was commissioned by gallery artist Egill Saebjornsson to design, develop, and build a series of artworks. The installations create a generative environment of interacting projection mapped animations and mechatronic sound sculptures. The works have been exhibited internationally and at international art fairs. Roles: Software development, hardware development, physical computing

 Machine Drawings for Print Magazine I wrote a speculative essay for VICCA Journal about future shipping routes in the arctic sea. The article was accompanied by a series of visual artworks created using a customized drawing machine. Controlled by a software system I developed especially for the project, data visualizations were drawn onto an antique map of the Arctic Ocean. For a second work, the drawing machine recreated a technical blueprint of a ice breaking ship, yet exaggerated and almost surrealistic. The project was produced in collaboration with print design studio Identity Works. Roles: Software development, artistic research, writing, print media</description>
